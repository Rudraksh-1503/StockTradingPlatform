# StockTradingPlatform
New Repository
The Stock Trading Platform is a Java-based simulation of a real-world trading environment, built using the principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). It provides users with the ability to view live market data, execute buy/sell operations, and track their portfolio performance over time. The application demonstrates how trading systems work in practice, while maintaining simplicity for learning and experimentation.

ðŸ”¹ Key Features

Market Data Simulation

A set of popular stocks (e.g., AAPL, TSLA, MSFT, AMZN) are available for trading.

Stock prices are updated randomly to mimic real-time market fluctuations.

Users can view the latest stock list with current prices before making decisions.

Buy & Sell Operations

Users start with an initial cash balance (e.g., $10,000).

They can purchase shares of any available stock, provided they have enough funds.

Users can also sell stocks from their portfolio, instantly updating cash and holdings.

Portfolio Management

Displays userâ€™s current cash balance, owned stocks, average cost per share, and market value.

Tracks unrealized gains/losses, giving a clear picture of performance.

Maintains a structured list of holdings using the Holding class.

Transaction History

Every buy/sell operation is logged as a transaction with symbol, quantity, price, and timestamp.

Users can review their trading history to analyze past decisions.

Persistence with File I/O

The portfolio (cash, holdings, and transactions) is saved into a file (portfolio.dat).

When the program is restarted, the user can continue from where they left off.

Demonstrates practical use of serialization in Java.

ðŸ”¹ OOP Design

The project is built using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts:

Stock â€“ Represents an individual stock with attributes like symbol, name, and current price.

Market â€“ Maintains a collection of stocks and updates their prices.

Holding â€“ Represents the number of shares and average cost of a stock owned by the user.

Transaction â€“ Stores details of each buy/sell action performed by the user.

Portfolio â€“ Manages userâ€™s cash, holdings, and transactions.

TradingPlatform (Main) â€“ Provides the user interface and ties everything together.

This modular approach makes the system extensible (new features like dividends, short-selling, or database integration can be added easily).

ðŸ”¹ Learning Outcomes

Demonstrates stock trading logic in a simplified environment.

Applies OOP concepts: abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance (optionally), and polymorphism.

Implements file handling and serialization to persist user data.

Shows how to simulate dynamic market conditions using randomization.

Provides a foundation for web-based trading systems (e.g., upgrading to Spring Boot + REST APIs).
